**STEPS TO EXECUTE THE CODE**

1. Download the dataset "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection"
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
      Open the file: fraud_detection_final.ipynb
3. Run All Cells Sequentially
      Start from the top.
      Execute each code cell one by one.
4. After Execution
      You will see:
         ~ Model accuracy
         ~ Confusion matrix
         ~ Classification report
         ~ A .pkl file (saved model) will be created in the project folder.
5. Note
      Do not interrupt while model training is happening (takes a few minutes).


Now your fraud detection system is ready!
